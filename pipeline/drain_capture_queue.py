"""drain_capture_queue.py — turn a captured paper into a corpus paper.

Charter charters/2026-09-08-ext-we3-capture-charter.md decision D-W3-6 created this script as a
LINK-ONLY drain: a capture that missed the corpus left an EXTERNAL library item
(`paper_id IS NULL`, the scraped record in `ext_meta`) plus one `library_capture_queue` row, and
each run only re-ran the lookup to see whether a later crawl had brought the paper in. Owner
decision O1 (docs/CAPTURE_INGEST_VETTING_DESIGN.md section 4, 2026-09-17) supersedes D-W3-6's
"never writes to `papers`" and its test T3: this script now INGESTS the work as well, and it is
the only writer that does so for a captured paper. Design: docs/ledger/capture-drain-ingest.md
item 4.

Why here and not in the web app: `papers` keeps one normalization and one writer. The capture
route resolves the work seconds after the click (`lib/library/resolve-work.ts`) and stores the
raw record on the queue row; this script normalizes it with the same functions the journal crawl
uses (`ingest_work.py`) and inserts through the same `upsert_paper()`. A TypeScript writer would
be a second normalization, and would fire the author and journal triggers with scraped strings.

Invariants:
  * `origin`, `vetted` and `corpus_tier` are written ON INSERT ONLY. A new row is
    `corpus_tier = 'core'` when `source_discipline()` resolves its venue to a configured journal
    and `'staged'` otherwise (migration 067, docs/ledger/lp3-capture-proof.md): a staged paper has
    no page, is in no list or corpus-wide computation, and touches neither the author resolver nor
    `journals.paper_count` until `promote_captured.py` promotes it. When `upsert_paper()` MATCHES
    an existing row the drain links the item and changes nothing on the paper — it never lowers
    `vetted`, never rewrites `origin`, and never changes `corpus_tier` (a staged row hit again
    stays staged; only promote_captured.py promotes it). Writing `'staged'` needs 067's CHECK, so
    this file must not run against a database without 067.
  * Every version bump goes through the LOCKED COUNTER — `merge_papers.BUMP_SQL`, the statement
    `lib/library/version.ts` uses — taken BEFORE any row of that user's data is touched (the same
    lock order as the app and the corpus merge). A bump that bypasses the counter can be ordered
    below a concurrent web push, and every client's sync cursor then skips the drain's write.
  * One transaction per queue row, claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so two runs (the
    30-minute schedule and a per-capture repository_dispatch) never take the same row. Inside it,
    `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on the identifier makes the second capture of one paper wait for the
    first's COMMIT instead of inserting a duplicate.
  * Linking is merge-aware and goes through the fold `merge_papers` already has
    (`_fold_library_rows`). Setting `paper_id` on the external row while the user already holds a
    row for that paper would violate UNIQUE (user_id, paper_id); instead the external row is
    folded into that row and tombstoned with `merged_into` naming it, which the sync client's
    AD-12 redirect map consumes to rewrite pending ops onto the winner.
  * Logs are public (the workflow runs in KisooKim/academic-crawler): they carry queue ids,
    DOIs, arXiv ids and paper ids only — never a user id, never a row, never `resolved_work`.

Status lifecycle (047): pending -> linked (re-point, ext_meta := NULL) | merged (fold +
tombstone) | closed (the item was tombstoned first, OR the work is not an article) | failed (14
days without a resolution). `linked` covers both tiers:
an ingested paper in an unconfigured venue is linked to the item as a staged paper, which the
library shows as a corpus item with no page (paper-meta `public` is false).

Resolution state, on the item's `ext_meta.resolution` and shown on the card (design item 7):
resolving -> not_indexed (nothing resolved yet; OpenAlex indexes new works 2-6 days after
publication) | incomplete (with the reason; `not_article:*` renders as "Not a paper") | resolved.

Import rows (ledger task lp3-import-enqueue, design docs/library/LP3_SWITCH_DESIGN_v2.md 5.7). The
import commit and pipeline/backfill_import_queue.py enqueue imported external items with
`scraped.origin = 'import'`; the capture route writes `origin = 'capture'`. An import row is resolved,
ingested, linked or folded exactly as a capture row, with two differences:
  * Claim order (`CLAIM_ORDER`): every claimable capture row before any import row, and import rows
    in `created_at` order, across users too (first in, first out: a second user's import waits
    behind a first user's whole backlog; round-robin by user is the known follow-up).
  * Logs: an import row prints no per-row line, so a public run never lists a person's library in
    submission order. A run prints the count of import rows per outcome.
  * Time budget: once a run has spent IMPORT_BUDGET_S seconds it claims no more import rows
    (capture rows are still claimed up to the row limit), so a large import keeps each run well
    inside the workflow's 20-minute timeout and a capture's dispatch never waits long behind it.
    The run then logs how many import rows are left for the next run.

A row whose processing raises (any row): its open transaction is rolled back, but what the row had
already committed stays (upsert_paper() commits the connection, so an ingested paper and the stored
`resolved_work` can already be in). The attempt is then recorded in its own transaction:
`attempts + 1`, `last_attempt_at = now()`, `last_error` = the exception's class name (never its
message, which can carry a DOI). The row stays pending, so the claim predicate's backoff skips it on
the next runs, until it is older than FAILED_AFTER_DAYS: then it becomes `failed` and its card
`incomplete` (not_indexed), as the expiry of a row that resolves nothing does. The run goes on with
the next row up to its limit. The log line names the queue id and the exception class only. The
process exits non-zero when a row raised on its first attempt (`attempts` was 0), so the workflow's
failure mail fires once per bad row, and when the run could not claim a row or record an attempt.

  python pipeline/drain_capture_queue.py [--dry-run] [--limit N] [--dsn URL] [--no-network]

`--dsn` defaults to DATABASE_URL from the environment (.env.local is loaded, never overriding).
`--dry-run` performs the lookups and prints each row's decision without writing.
`--no-network` skips the resolution arm (rows with no `resolved_work` are left pending) — for a
rehearsal that must not call OpenAlex.
