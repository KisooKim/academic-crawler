"""identity_gates.py — the author-identity gates, read-only, in one file the crawler can run.

Specification: docs/ledger/arxiv-daily-pass.md (design item 2), from the gates of
docs/tierb/ARXIV_AUTHOR_ID_BACKFILL_WORKORDER.md section 7. The daily author-ID pass
(.github/workflows/author-ids.yml in KisooKim/academic-crawler) runs this before and after
backfill_arxiv_author_ids.py: the first run prints the timestamp the second passes back as
--since, and the second run's exit code fails the job.

  python pipeline/identity_gates.py [--since TIMESTAMP] [--json FILE]

The database is DATABASE_URL (pipeline/db.py). The session is read-only, so the script cannot
write even by accident, and nothing here needs rehearse_043.py or repair_author_links.py: G1's
element scan reads author_elements() through a lateral join instead of the temporary table those
scripts share.

Six lines, printed one per line. Three are gates and a failing one exits 1:

  G1              every link's element OpenAlex ID is an alias of the row it links to
  G2              every authors.openalex_id is an alias of its own row, and no aliased row is
                  missing its canonical ID
  resolver-error  no author_link_conflicts row of kind resolver-error since --since

Three are reported, and never fail the run:

  conflicts-added  author_link_conflicts rows since --since, by kind
  provisional      rows with no OpenAlex ID and no ORCID: the plain count, and the count gated on
                   created_at < --since, which leaves out the rows a concurrent crawl created
  leak             keyed rows (an OpenAlex ID) older than 7 days that hold no link at all, with up
                   to 20 of their ids. The daily pass creates keyed rows and the trigger moves the
                   links onto them; a keyed row left holding nothing is how a lost link shows up,
                   for instance if a re-crawl were to strip the IDs the pass wrote.
