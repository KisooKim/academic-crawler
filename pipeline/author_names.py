"""author_names.py — author-name normalization and the author-element merge guard.

norm_name() and name_agreement() moved here from probe_openalex_arxiv.py (behavior unchanged).

merge_author_elements() is the guard upsert_paper() applies when it rewrites the `authors` of a
paper that already exists (docs/ledger/author-elements-merge-guard.md; decision D4 of
docs/tierb/ARXIV_AUTHOR_ID_BACKFILL_WORKORDER.md). The arXiv crawler sends names only and re-fetches a
paper for up to 13 days, so without the guard a re-crawl would strip the OpenAlex IDs a later pass
wrote into the elements.
